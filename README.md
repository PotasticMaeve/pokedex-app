# Pokedex App

## Overview

The **Pokedex App** is a React Native mobile application that allows users to browse and search a list of Pokemon using data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). The app provides several key features such as displaying a list of Pok√©mon with their sprites and names, enabling users to search the list locally, view detailed Pokemon information, and toggle Pokemon items as favorites. Additionally, the app includes local storage functionality for saving favorited Pokemon using **react-native-async-storage**.

### Key Features:

1. **Browse Pokemon List**

2. **Search Pokemon**  
   - Users can search for Pokemon by their name locally within the list (local search functionality).

3. **Pokemon Detail Screen**  
   - Users can tap a Pokemon in the list to view detailed information:
     - Pokemon name
     - A gallery of Pokemon sprites
     - A list of abilities
   
4. **Favorites**  
   - Users can toggle a Pokemon as a favorite by pressing a heart icon.
   - Favorited Pokemon are saved in local storage on the device using **react-native-async-storage**.
